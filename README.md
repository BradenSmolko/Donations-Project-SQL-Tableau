# Donations-Project-SQL-Tableau

** In Progress **

### Setup
To practice SQL and Tableau, I created 4 tables of fake data using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/). I then imported these tables into a MS SQL Server instance on my local machine. After using SQL to explore and query the data in the server, I connected the database to Tableau to further explore and visualize the data.

### Premise
Imagine you are working for a non-profit group that relies on donations. Your group has a database with 4 tables: donor, donation, organization, and communication. Your boss asks you to answer some questions using this data and to generate some email lists for your group. You will write SQL queries and create visuals in Tableau to answer their requests.

### Files
* The Donations-Project.sql file contains commented queries to answer the requests using the database
* The Donations Data folder contains the generated .csv files used for this project and descriptions of the tables and fields
* The Visualizations folder conatains the visuals created from the data with Tableau
